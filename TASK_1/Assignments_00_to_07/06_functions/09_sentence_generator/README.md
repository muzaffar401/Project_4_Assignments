# Sentence Generator

This project is a simple Python program that generates sentences based on user input.

## How It Works

1. The `make_sentence` function takes a word and a part of speech (noun, verb, or adjective) as arguments.
2. The `main` function prompts the user to enter a word and specify its part of speech (0 for noun, 1 for verb, 2 for adjective).
3. The program then calls `make_sentence` to generate and print a sentence using the given word.

## Requirements
- Python 3+

## Running the Project
Run the following command in the terminal:
```sh
python app.py
```

This project demonstrates basic user input handling, conditional statements, and function usage in Python.
