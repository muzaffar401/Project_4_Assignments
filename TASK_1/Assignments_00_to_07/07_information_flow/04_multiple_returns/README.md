# User Information Collector

This project is a Python program that collects a user's basic information, including their first name, last name, and email address.

## How It Works

- The program prompts the user to enter their first name, last name, and email address.
- It calls the `get_user_info()` function, which returns these details as a tuple.
- The program then displays the collected information to the user.

## Requirements
- Python 3+

## Running the Project
Run the following command in the terminal:
```sh
python app.py
```

This project demonstrates user input handling, function usage, and tuple operations in Python.
