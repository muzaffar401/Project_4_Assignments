# Subtract Seven Program

This project is a simple Python program that demonstrates function usage by subtracting 7 from a given number.

## How It Works

- The program initializes a number (`num`) with a value of 7.
- It calls the `subtract_seven(num)` function, which subtracts 7 from the number and returns the result.
- The program then prints the result, which should be zero.

## Requirements
- Python 3+

## Running the Project
Run the following command in the terminal:
```sh
python app.py
```

This project demonstrates function usage, basic arithmetic operations, and program execution in Python.
